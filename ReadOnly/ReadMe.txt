PgP 1/7/2026-
Note- the files in this folder, especially CourseConstants.js, are modified to work with MIS362-90 for the BUSO program.
the HomePage.html still relies on the 'code/grading/CourseAssignmentSubmissions.asp' reporting file because the Formative and Summative are still sending old
school data to sql server- or something like that. bottom line-these files will be needed in spring 2028 unless you copy everything from the MIS362 ftf
class
